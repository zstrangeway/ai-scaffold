# Progress: my-scaffold-project

## What Works
- **Conceptualization & Planning:**
    - Detailed project plan and architecture defined.
    - Core technologies and stack choices finalized.
    - Structure for Memory Bank (`.memory/`) and AI Context (`.cursor/`) established.
- **Initial Memory Bank Population:**
    - `.memory/projectbrief.md` created and populated.
    - `.memory/productContext.md` created and populated.
    - `.memory/memory_bank_instructions.md` created and populated.
    - `.memory/activeContext.md` created and populated.
    - `.memory/systemPatterns.md` created and populated.
    - `.memory/techContext.md` created and populated.
- **AI Persona Definition:**
    - `.cursor/rules/persona.mdc` created to guide AI collaboration.

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps - Initial Scaffolding)
- **This `progress.md` file needs to be finalized.**
- **Create `.cursor/rules/memory_conventions.mdc`** to document how the AI should use memory files.
- **Delete the now-redundant `.cursor/memory.md** planning file.
- **Root Project Files:**
    - Create root `package.json` for pnpm workspaces.
    - Create `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
    - Create initial `README.md` (can be simple, pointing to Memory Bank for details).
    - Create `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore`.
    - Create basic `docker-compose.yml` structure.
- **Directory Structure:**
    - Create `apps/`, `packages/`, `services/` directories.
    - Create sub-directories for each app/package/service (e.g., `apps/web_site`, `packages/ui`, `services/user_service`).
    - Initialize `.cursor/rules.md` (as a directory) and `.cursor/memory.md` files within each sub-project as they are scaffolded.
- **`packages/ui` Scaffolding:**
    - Initialize `package.json`.
    - Setup Tailwind CSS.
    - Initialize `shadcn/ui` (`components.json`).
    - Create a couple of example shared components.
- **Frontend App Scaffolding (e.g., `apps/web_site`):**
    - Initialize `package.json` with Vite + React + TypeScript.
    - Setup Tailwind CSS, ensuring it processes `packages/ui`.
    - Configure path aliases for `packages/ui`.
    - Implement basic i18n setup (`i18next`, `en/common.json`).
    - Create basic app structure (e.g., `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, example page).
- **Backend Service Scaffolding (e.g., `services/user_service` or `services/gateway_service`):**
    - Initialize Python project (`pyproject.toml` with Poetry/PDM).
    - Setup FastAPI basic app structure.
    - Create `Dockerfile`.
    - Add to `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Further Scaffolding (Iterative):**
    - Continue scaffolding other frontend apps and backend services.
    - Implement basic functionality (e.g., user endpoints, basic auth flow via gateway).
    - Write initial tests.

## Known Issues and Limitations (at this very early stage)
- No actual code for applications or services exists yet.
- The Memory Bank is based on planning; it will need to be updated as implementation progresses and decisions are validated or evolve.
- Tooling (linters, formatters, test runners) is planned but not yet configured.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Initial Misunderstanding of "memory-bank-mcp":** Initially interpreted as using generic MCP knowledge graph tools. Clarified to mean the specific 7 Markdown file structure for the Memory Bank.
- **Role of `.cursor/memory.md`:** Initially thought to be a persistent high-level planning doc. Clarified that the 7 `.memory/` files are the sole source of truth for project memory, and `.cursor/memory.md` should be deleted after they are populated.
- **`.cursor/rules/` as a directory:** Corrected the initial assumption that `.cursor/rules.md` was a file; it is a directory to hold multiple `.mdc` rule files.
