# Product Context: my-scaffold-project

## Problem Statement
Starting new full-stack software projects often involves significant repetitive setup work for common architectural patterns, technology stacks, and foundational features. This includes configuring monorepos, setting up frontend and backend frameworks, establishing communication between services, integrating basic UI components, and implementing core functionalities like user management or notifications. This boilerplate work consumes valuable development time that could be spent on building unique product features. Furthermore, maintaining consistency and best practices across multiple projects can be challenging without a standardized starting point.

## User Experience Goals (for developers using the scaffold)
- **Rapid Onboarding:** Developers should be able to clone the scaffold and get a fully functional local development environment running with minimal commands and configuration.
- **Clarity and Intuitiveness:** The project structure, code organization, and documentation should be clear, making it easy for developers to understand how different parts of the system work and where to add new features.
- **Extensibility and Maintainability:** The scaffold should be designed in a modular way that allows developers to easily add, remove, or modify components and services without excessive coupling or complexity.
- **AI-Collaboration Ready:** The scaffold should be structured to facilitate efficient collaboration with AI coding assistants, with clear context boundaries and conventions.

## Success Metrics (for the scaffold project itself)
- **Time to "Hello World" for a new project:** Reduction in time required for a developer to fork the scaffold and have a basic, runnable version of their new application.
- **Adoption Rate:** Number of new projects initiated by forking this scaffold.
- **Developer Feedback:** Positive feedback regarding ease of use, clarity of architecture, and acceleration of development.
- **Consistency Across Projects:** Observable consistency in tech stack, structure, and core feature implementation in projects derived from the scaffold.
- **Reduced Boilerplate:** Measurable reduction in the amount of boilerplate code developers need to write for new projects.
